	<p>As it turns out, <em>re-imagining</em> SS13 is a bit harder than simply <em>re-making</em> it. Not that that deters us.</p>

<h2 id="kaboom-contributed-by-injazz">Kaboom (Contributed by Injazz)</h2>

<p><video src="/video/19_07_07-boom.webm" controls></p>

<p>Yeah it could use some polish. Baby steps though.</p>

<h2 id="interaction-rework">Interaction Rework</h2>

<p>The primary method of interacting with the game world is clicking via your hand. We all know how this works and I will say is quite intuitive. That doesn&rsquo;t mean however it cannot be improved upon.</p>

<p>One of the biggest nuisances I personally have with SS13 is that having your hands full basically makes it impossible to do many things like just <em>opening</em> computer interfaces. This usually results in you having to akwardly drop things just to open a computer interface. Of course SS13 only cares about this when <em>opening</em> the interface and ignores the items in your hand actually using it.</p>

<p>This is a massive paper cut. I want to be able to use computers, open lockers, etc&hellip; without having to drop things in my hand. Now yes, you could argue that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t use a computer while you&rsquo;re holding toolboxes&rdquo;. You would be right, but I definitely could use a computer while holding a screwdriver. Any further detail into this just feels like simulating things that aren&rsquo;t actually <em>fun</em>. Also I can totally <em>look</em> at a computer screen with toolboxes in my hand. Not so much the case for SS13.</p>

<p><strong>The gist is</strong> that we assigned the <code>E</code> key to act as a permanent &ldquo;interact with empty hand&rdquo; button. So if you want to use a computer, you can just hit E instead of having to drop whatever you&rsquo;re holding. This should hopefully cut out a lot of finnicky item manipulation and make the game just a bit more streamlined.</p>

<h2 id="outlines">Outlines!</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post/pr_16/outline.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yep, it actually cover the whole entity now!</p>

<p>If you went and actually tried to download SS14 (you should!), you&rsquo;ll probably have noticed that outlines for the entity under your mouse were.. pretty broken.</p>

<p>Drawing these outlines is actually a lot more annoying than it may look at first sight. The outline has to consider the <em>entire</em> entity, not just be ran layer-by-layer (which is what was happening before). Graphics APIs only really allow you to draw layer by layer though. This is a solved problem of course, just draw the entity into its own framebuffer and then apply the outline to <em>that</em>. While I cannot speak for an engine like Unity, I can already tell you there is just no sane way to implement this in Godot without <em>many</em> hacks. I&rsquo;m quite glad we dropped Godot, because it was <em>relatively</em> simple to implement this in our own renderer.</p>

<p>Outlines are looking pretty fancy now. They&rsquo;re not perfect (could use some better contrast in light areas), but now that&rsquo;s just some GLSL shader code away, instead of massive renderer reworks. If somebody&rsquo;s feeling brave, it should be quite easy to improve!</p>
