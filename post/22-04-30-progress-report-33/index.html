all!</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h2 id=progress-report-tweaks>Progress Report Tweaks</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve had a hell of time trying to figure out what to do about the <em>huge</em> number of features, fixes, and tweaks that happened in March. As a result we&rsquo;re going to be experimenting with some formatting changes over the course of the next few Progress Reports to determine the best way of presenting the large quantity of information.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h2 id=content>Content</h2><h3 id=april-stress-test>April Stress Test</h3><p>On April 9th we hosted a stress test with as many players as possible to see how well the server could handle it, peaking at 250 players! Normally April events would go in the April progress report, but we&rsquo;re including it here while it&rsquo;s hopefully still fresh in all of the participants&rsquo; minds.</p><p>Space Station 14 was able to run with 200 players without any server slowdown. The stress test peaked at ~250 players and we predict that it could have surpassed ~350 without slowdown. However, although the server can handle it, we noticed some networking issues that can cause rubberbanding with this many players. The probable cause has been identified and efforts to fix it are underway.</p><p>For a highlight reel of the chaos caused by 250 players, you can watch the YouTube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__5K6pWj1Ls">here</a>.</p><details><summary>See here for a more technical breakdown of performance</summary><p>There are two parts to how the game processes things: A unit of time called a &ldquo;tick&rdquo; during which the game simulates everything, and the &ldquo;ticks per second (TPS)&rdquo; which is the rate at which ticks occur. For example, 30 TPS means that one second is divided into 30 ticks of equal length and the game will attempt to update 30 times per second. More ticks per second means less time for each tick, and if the game isn&rsquo;t finished running the code by the time the tick ends then the game will lag. On the flip side, a higher TPS means the game will feel more responsive. Choosing the right TPS is a balancing act, and the upper limit mainly depends on how performant the game is.</p><p>Space Station 14 was able to run at our usual 30 TPS with over 200 players largely without issue. After lowering it to 20 TPS, which is what most SS13 servers use, the stress test peaked at ~250 players and continued to perform fine (aka everything was able to run during the allotted ticks).</p></details><p>tl;dr SS14 can definitely handle over 250 players and can probably handle over 350 players before the server starts to lag. Unless you do something wild like give everyone mechs with rocket launchers. Not too shabby, in my opinion.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=explosion-refactor>Explosion Refactor</h3><p><em>Contributed by ElectroSR</em></p><p>Explosions have been completely refactored to be more visually and technically impressive.

Previously, explosions worked by using a simple raycast to check for obstructions and then dealt damage to exposed entities based on their distance to the epicenter. Not only was this actually quite slow for large explosions, it also meant that any explosion would only ever destroy a single layer of walls.</p><p>The new explosion code uses a grid-based algorithm that iteratively looks for neighboring tiles to add to the explosion. Airtight entities (i.e., walls) effectively delay the flood-fill in some directions, with a delay proportional to their health. The end result is that explosion can now properly penetrate multiple layers of walls, with each layer appropriately reducing the damage dealt to the next one. Additionally, the area that gets affected by an explosion is shaped by airtight obstacles. Explosions can now go around corners, and will deal more damage and travel further in confined areas.</p><p>The most convoluted part of the new explosion code is the need to support multiple rotated & translated shuttles and stations. It is challenging to have grid-based explosions that properly propagate onto and off of these grids, while also being blocked by airtight entities on those grids, and there are still some edge cases were explosions can skip past walls. Another challenge was ensuring that all the code is fast enough to allow for real-time nuking of the station. The biggest bottleneck is currently due to entity spawning and deletion, but there is also some physics slowdown due to having thousands of entities launched into space. Currently a station-destroying explosion still causes very noticeable stuttering, but there is still plenty of room for improvement.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h2 id=credits>Credits</h2><h3 id=contributors-since-last-progress-report>Contributors Since Last Progress Report</h3><p><em>439 commits, authored by: Alex Evgrashin, Carou02, Chris V, CrudeWax, Daemon, Delete69, DrSmugleaf, ElectroSr, Emisse, EmoGarbage404, Fishfish458, Flipp Syder, Jack Fox, Jane Lewis, Jezithyr, Julian Giebel, Kai Shiba, Kevin Zheng, Leeroy, Mith-randalf, Moony, Morbo, Pancake, Paul, Peptide90, Pieter-Jan Briers, Radrark, Rane, ScalyChimp, ShadowCommander, Silver, Snowni, T-Stalker, TaralGit, TimrodDX, Veritius, WTCWR68, Willhelm53, Zoldorf, actually-reb, areit, ike709, lapatison, metalgearsloth, mirrorcult, ninruB, retequizzle, router, wrexbe, Zumorica</em></p><h3 id=patrons>Patrons</h3><p><em>Altana, Anthony Chicko, Anthony Fleck, AquaDraco, Austin Nelson, Blaise M., Callum Tubrett, Collin R Terrell, Cormos Lemming, CPM311, Dan Griskardian, Daniel Thompson, Darren Brady, Daskata, DramaBuns, Durp, Eric VW, Ethan Keller, Evan Armstrong, Farewell Fire, Florian, Frege Beach, grhmhome, Hamcha, hh, Jack Rose, James Andrew Peoples Jr, Jex N, Joel, John Edward Hamilton Barchard, Joshington Awesomahee, JustanAnus, Koyki, Kris Piper, KrystalDisc, Miniwoffer, Mono, Nicholas Hillblom, Oxyclean114, Peter &ldquo;Azmond&rdquo; Newhouse, Phillip Inman, Rafał Kowalewski, Robin Rottstock, Seija, Serathis, Shayne Haugen, Spiffyfishface, spinnermaster, Taylor, ThatGuyGW, The Hateful Flesh, Tom Cruize, Tomeno, Valinov, vifs_vestige, Viridian, Will M., Wrexbe, Zakanater 19, Zandario</em></p></div></article></div></main><div id=footer-wrap class=section-shadow><footer class="bottom-links container angle-rect optional mb-2"><ul class="m-2 p-0 d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center"><li><a href=https://github.com/space-wizards title=GitHub><i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://docs.spacestation14.com title=Documentation><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Developer Wiki</a></li><li><a href=https://wiki.spacestation14.io/wiki/Main_Page title="Player Wiki"><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Player Wiki</a></li><li><a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255460/Space_Station_14/ title=Steam><i class="fab fa-steam-symbol"></i> Steam</a></li><li><a href=https://www.patreon.com/spacestation14 title=Patreon><i class="fab fa-patreon"></i> Patreon</a></li><li><a href=https://discord.ss14.io/ title=Discord><i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Discord</a></li><li><a href=https://forum.spacestation14.com title="SS14 Forums"><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Forum</a></li><li><a href=https://lemmy.spacestation14.com title=Lemmy><i class="fas fa-stream"></i> Lemmy</a></li><li><a href=https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@spacestation14 rel=me title=RSS><i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Mastodon</a></li><li><a href=/about/contact/#email title=Email><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> Email</a></li><li><a href=/index.xml title=RSS><i class="fas fa-rss"></i> RSS</a></li><li><a href=/about/privacy/ title="Privacy Policy"><i class="fas fa-shield"></i> Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></footer></div></body></html>
