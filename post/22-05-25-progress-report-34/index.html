class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h2 id=content>Content</h2><h3 id=delta-updates>Delta Updates</h3><p><em>Contributed by PJB</em></p><p>The launcher is now capable of only downloading new or changed files whenever a server updates. This means you won&rsquo;t have to sit through a 55 MB (at the time of writing) update whenever a single tiny feature gets added. The size of our game content has grown dramatically in the last couple months as more and more content keeps coming in, and with it the download times got much worse for everybody. I apologize to anybody with poor internet for not getting this done sooner.</p><p>Additionally, downloaded assets will now be shared between servers regardless of the code they&rsquo;re running. So if two different servers use the same floor sprites, for example, you&rsquo;ll only download them once. It just works. More details are available in the Technical section.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=zstd-game-state-compression>Zstd Game State Compression</h3><p><em>Contributed by PJB</em></p><p>PJB also added Zstd compression to game states, which is a complicated way of saying that the game should generally use less bandwidth now. Technically-inclined users can find more details in the Technical section.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=machine-linking-improvements>Machine Linking Improvements</h3><p><em>Contributed by DubiousDoggo & ElectroSR</em></p><p>Linking machines on the station has never been easier, thanks to a new change that allows anyone with a multitool to apply a default link to blast doors, shutters, and anything else capable of linking. This will no doubt save the greyshirts trying to pop open the blast doors to EVA storage several clicks.</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_34/linking.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_34/linking.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=artifact-container>Artifact Container</h3><p><em>Contributed by Macoron</em></p><p>The eggheads over in R&amp;D have come up with a cure for premature activation&mldr; of xenoarcheology artifacts, that is.</p><p>The new Artifact Container will safely contain any artifacts the salvage crew come across, thus enabling safe transportation to a more suitable testing environment.</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_34/artifact_container.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_34/artifact_container.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=grid-splitting>Grid Splitting</h3><p><em>Contributed by metalgearsloth</em></p><p>Every station, shuttle, asteroid, et cetera can now be broken up into multiple unique grids. For example, if an asteroid smashed all the way through a shuttle mid-transit, you&rsquo;d see the two halves fly off in different directions as the portion with the engines strapped to it continues accelerating. More technical details can be found in the Technical section, but here&rsquo;s a more direct visual aid:</p><p>Using the power of admin tools, I sawed this station in half!</p><div class=section-shadow><video src=/video/pr_34/split.mp4 class="angle-rect optional" loop playsinline controls></video></div></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=salvage-mining--ore-processing>Salvage Mining & Ore Processing</h3><p><em>Contributed by HoofedEar</em></p><p>The salvage crews have made a shocking discovery: All of those asteroid rocks are full of valuable minerals!

To begin, an overview of how the previous updating system worked:</p><p>All the client contents are combined into a simple zip file when the game is built. This zip is hashed (SHA-256) and this hash, together with data such as download URL, &ldquo;Fork ID&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fork Version&rdquo; is included with the server build. The server reports this information to the launcher via its HTTP API when you try to connect to it. The launcher downloads the zip to disk (if it doesn&rsquo;t have it yet), verifies the hash, and then runs the engine with this zip file mounted to run the actual game. The game server can optionally serve the zip itself to ease hosting in some cases, which is known as &ldquo;Automated Client Zipping&rdquo; (ACZ).</p><p>The upside is that this system is quite simple. The engine can mount zip files natively, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;just a single file to download&rdquo;, zip files are common and easy to work with, etc&mldr;
The downside is that the tiniest file change requires redownloading the whole 55 MB zip file again. Not everybody has a great internet connection. Oof.</p><p><strong>Step one</strong> when tackling this problem was to get rid of zip files. We effectively used the SHA-256 hash of the zip as a way to identify the contents of the game server. While this is cryptographically secure, it is hard to work with: if you wanted to make a delta updating system, you&rsquo;d need to exactly reproduce the zip file bytes, not just the contents inside it&mldr; So then hash said contents directly instead! The actual identity of the server contents are now represented via a manifest. The manifest looks like this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Robust Content Manifest 1

</code></pre><p>The manifest simply contains the BLAKE2b<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> hash and the file path for each file in the game. This manifest is then hashed itself, and this hash is used as the source of truth instead of the zip file. It&rsquo;s easy to generate programmatically and simple text.</p><p><strong>Step two</strong> is for the launcher to store game files based on their hash, allowing us to deduplicate files if they are used by multiple servers<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. We decided to store them in a simple SQLite WAL database: it&rsquo;s decently fast, transactional, and effectively guarantees data consistency. We call it ContentDB. When downloading zip files from servers that are not configured for manifest downloads (see below), we simply download the zip and ingest it into the DB. This requires us to reconstruct the manifest from scratch and at least decompress & hash all the files, but it&rsquo;s not that bad. Blobs inside the database can also be compressed with ZStd, saving a good chunk of disk space.</p><p><strong>Step three</strong> is a new download protocol that allows us to only download new files we need. The protocol is very simple: The launcher first downloads the manifest from the CDN server (the game server if using ACZ), then the launcher requests a list of all blobs it is missing to said CDN server, which responds with them. All of this happens over HTTP. The blob download itself uses a single POST request with a binary request/response to minimize overhead.</p><p>If it&rsquo;s optimal, the CDN can provide individually pre-compressed blobs so the launcher can directly load them into the database without re-compression. When downloading large amounts of files however doing a compression over the whole stream gives better savings, so that is selected instead.</p><p>Outside of many Linux users initially having trouble due to library loading conflicts with ZStd, the new system seems to be working very nicely.</p><h4 id=possible-improvements>Possible Improvements</h4><p>There are a few areas of improvement to the system:</p><p><strong>Manifest sizes:</strong> We have a lot of tiny files in the game due to the RSI format. This makes it so that manifests get really big (even when compressed, hashes don&rsquo;t compress by nature). A larger-than-I&rsquo;d-like amount of data needs to be downloaded just for the initial manifest, even on the tiniest of possible updates. We intend to alleviate this by eventually packing RSIs together in game downloads. Another option is a more complex tree-based manifest format (and requesting protocol thereof) that would allow us to skip whole directories if their contents haven&rsquo;t changed.</p><p><strong>Active CDN:</strong> The download protocol requires an active CDN server to be efficient. This allows us to optimize the actual bandwidth usage a lot (small protocol, optimal downloads) but this might be outweighed simply by not being able to use &ldquo;standard&rdquo; CDN servers.</p><p>A few days before rolling out the manifest downloading system, Veloren posted a <a href=https://veloren.net/devblog-165/#incremental-airshipper-updates-by-aweinstock>dev blog announcing their new incremental downloading system</a>. Veloren&rsquo;s model simply uses HTTP range requests over their pre-existing zip file downloads, allowing them to use a regular CDN. I can&rsquo;t say that if I was making the delta system from scratch now I wouldn&rsquo;t use this method instead, but it is what it is.</p><p><strong>Dictionaries</strong>: ZStd has support for dictionaries, allowing you to pre-share some data for compression between multiple frames (files, basically). This could allow us to reduce download & disk size even more in many cases. Some questions we need to ponder about before implementing this though: Do we permanently pack a preset of dictionaries with the launcher, or do we allow servers to dynamically generate a set of dictionaries for their content?</p><p><strong>Binary deltas</strong>: We still can only send whole files when a file needs to be downloaded. The game&rsquo;s compiled assemblies easily weigh more than half a megabyte. Ideally we would be able to supply binary patches<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> instead, to only transmit the changes from the previous file versions. A challenge here is that the <code>.dll</code> files don&rsquo;t diff well, but I believe that with a specialized tool to re-organize them internally we could get huge savings.</p><p><strong>Interrupting and resuming downloads</strong>: Right now the launcher needs to do a whole download in one go to actually store it to disk<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>. If you already have files and are just downloading an update this isn&rsquo;t a problem, but the hurdle of large initial downloads (fresh launcher, first ever connection) might prove problematic with people with poorer internet connections. Ideally the launcher could resume interrupted downloads with the files it already has.</p><p><strong>Improving ACZ load performance</strong>: ACZ takes a long time to initialize on the server now. It&rsquo;s not too bad, but I would prefer if it were faster (&lt;1 second). This is purely down to lackluster design on <code>System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive</code> making it impossible to efficiently handle zip files, nothing more. I couldn&rsquo;t be arsed to make my own non-terrible zip file library, at least not yet.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=zstd-game-state-compression-technical>Zstd Game State Compression (Technical)</h3><p><em>Contributed by PJB</em></p><p>As part of the above work on deltas I got a little familiar with Zstd, the modern compression algorithm used by it. I swapped out the old game state compressor with it for some speed ups.</p><p>We previously just used .NET&rsquo;s <code>DeflateStream</code> to do compression. The problem is that this API, like many, was not actually designed with any sort of performance in mind:</p><ol><li>Because it&rsquo;s a stream-based API, it always incurs at <em>least</em> one wasted memory copy that could be avoided in many cases. This is at least minor.</li><li>You couldn&rsquo;t really re-use <code>DeflateStream</code> across multiple compressions. This means you would be <em>constantly</em> allocating and de-allocating native compression contexts and other garbage just to run a compression algo.</li></ol><p>So switching from Deflate to Zstd did not only provide the advantage of using an algorithm that wasn&rsquo;t 28 years old, it also helped by allowing us to use a functional high-performance compression API. Hooray!</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=grid-splitting-technical>Grid Splitting (Technical)</h3><p><em>Contributed by metalgearsloth</em></p><p>Previously when you tried to saw a station in half there was no code detecting that a split had occurred which has now been added. Rather than checking every tile individually we group areas of tiles together as nodes and check those connections. This means that instead of potentially thousands of tiles we only check a handful of nodes to see if a split has occurred. The larger group of tiles is left as the original grid and the smaller group forms a new grid. Splitting off a solar array should be unnoticeable and sawing split station in half took ~250ms which we expect to get faster over time.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what the <code>showgridnodes</code> debug command looks like:</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_34/nodes.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_34/nodes.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=custom-midi-soundfont-support>Custom MIDI Soundfont Support</h3><p><em>Contributed by vulppine</em></p><p>MIDI sound fonts are now selectable by the end user in Robust Toolbox! They override any fonts loaded in by the server, and the default sound font used by your current system. This is beneficial for when you want to use other sound fonts in SS14 rather than the default one installed on your system, without having to replace any system files or deal with any configuration. In order to add any custom sound fonts to any Robust Toolbox game, you&rsquo;ll need to go into the user configuration folder related to the game in question, and add any sound fonts you want into the &lsquo;soundfonts&rsquo; folder.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=replaced-lidgren-encryption-with-libsodium>Replaced Lidgren Encryption with Libsodium</h3><p><em>Contributed by PJB</em></p><p>Since we added account authentication, communication with the game server has mostly been AES encrypted. This was built using Lidgren&rsquo;s <code>NetEncryption</code> system and, well, it worked. If you <a href=https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network/blob/11198c1c46ea721dbcbe99296570495ba9cd68a6/Lidgren.Network/Encryption/NetCryptoProviderBase.cs>check the code</a> and you know a little bit about AES however&mldr; Yeah it reuses IVs on CBC mode. Yeah that makes it automatically broken. Hooray!</p><p>Because I am not a cryptographic expert I decided that the best way to fix this was to simply replace this with Libsodium&rsquo;s <a href=https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/aead/chacha20-poly1305/xchacha20-poly1305_construction>AEAD XChaCha20-Poly1305 API</a>. I trust that the crypto is not completely broken now. I also completely tore out Lidgren&rsquo;s encryption support in our fork (it was evidently broken and didn&rsquo;t integrate with the internals anyways).</p><p>There are some gotchas here though. The first thing is that .NET didn&rsquo;t have an existing non-terrible Libsodium binding, so I had to make a partial binding for the APIs I care about myself: <a href=https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.Sodium>SpaceWizards.Sodium</a>.</p><p>The second problem is that this change does have a noticeable increase on bandwidth usage. This is because proper encryption™ has more overhead in the form of AEAD and IV that has to be sent. Lidgren has a feature where it combines many net messages we send into fewer larger UDP packets. This is good, but the missed optimization here is that encryption runs <em>before</em> this combining. Ideally we would run encryption afterwards and only needing to encrypt single UDP packets, saving us some bandwidth. This would require deeper integration with Lidgren&rsquo;s internals however, so this is something for the future.</p><p>I do believe that this new encryption system is at least faster CPU wise though, by the simple fact that .NET&rsquo;s crypto API is pretty terrible and Libsodium&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t. Just like the compression thing above!</p><p>It should be noted we&rsquo;ve basically been maintaining Lidgren on our own for a while now, since upstream has stopped development. Our fork is <a href=https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network>SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network</a>.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=spacewizardshttplistener>SpaceWizards.HttpListener</h3><p><em>Contributed by PJB</em></p><p>Continuing the trend of forking and doing things ourself, a problem that came up while developing deltas above is that <code>System.Net.HttpListener</code> was kinda bloody broken.</p><p>Let me back up for a second here. The .NET BCL has a type <code>System.Net.HttpListener</code> which is basically a lightweight HTTP server you can embed in your app. This is great! The problem is that it&rsquo;s basically completely abandoned by .NET in favor of &ldquo;just use ASP.NET Core lol&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> and is no longer being maintained.</p><p>The type was originally designed to wrap the <code>http.sys</code> Windows API. Outside Windows, an implementation that originates from Mono is now used. This has some funny consequences:</p><ol><li>The implementations are not consistent between Windows and Mac/Linux.</li><li>On Windows, listening to this HTTP listener requires admin access.</li><li>On Mac/Linux, the implementation is extremely buggy.</li></ol><p>To solve (1) and (2) we opted to manually compile the managed (Mac/Linux) version of the type and use it on Windows too. This already required us to copy the code into its own repo. This was done via a submodule though, so using it wasn&rsquo;t that convenient for other projects.</p><p>(3) however cropped up a <em>lot</em> while I was working on the delta-updates stuff, so I had to make multiple fixes myself to make this work. I didn&rsquo;t bother to upstream these since it&rsquo;s a ton of effort and there seems to be a lack of interest.</p><p>Because of this I decided to make a proper NuGet package and such for the effort, so it&rsquo;s easier to consume by others. Anyways uhhh, have <a href=https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.HttpListener/>SpaceWizards.HttpListener</a>!</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h2 id=credits>Credits</h2><h3 id=contributors-since-last-progress-report>Contributors Since Last Progress Report</h3><p><em>20kdc, Alainx277, AugustEymann, CrzyPotato, Daemon, Delete69, DogZeroX, DrSmugleaf, DubiousDoggo, ElectroSR, Emisse, EmoGarbage404, Fishfish458, freeman2651, HoofedEar, ike709, juliangiebel, KaiShibaa, keronshb, Leander-0, Macoron, metalgearsloth, Mirino97, mirrorcult, moony, Morb0, Pangogie, PaulRitter, Peptide90, PJB, ProfanedBane, Radosvik, Rane, Saakra, ShadowCommander, Snowni, Soupstraw, TaralGit, TimrodDX, UKNOWH, Veritius, vulppine, wrexbe, Zumorica</em></p><h3 id=patrons>Patrons</h3><p><em>Alex Fry, Altana, Anthony Fleck, AquaDraco, Austin Nelson, Blaise M., Bobberunio, Callum Tubrett, Collin R Terrell, Cormos Lemming, CPM311, Dan Griskardian, Daniel Thompson, Darren Brady, Daskata, DramaBuns, Durp, Eric VW, Ethan Keller, Evan Armstrong, Farewell Fire, Florian, Frege Beach, grhmhome, Hamcha, hh, Jack Rose, James Andrew Peoples Jr, Jex N, Joel, John Edward Hamilton Barchard, Joshington Awesomahee, JustanAnus, Koyki, Kris Piper, KrystalDisc, liltenhead, Mikhail, Miniwoffer, Mono, Nicholas Hillblom, Oxyclean114, Peter &ldquo;Azmond&rdquo; Newhouse, Phillip Inman, Ramiro Agis, Robin Rottstock, Seija, Serathis, SnapKick, Spiffyfishface, spinnermaster, Taylor, ThatGuyGW, The Hateful Flesh, Tom Cruize, Tomeno, Valinov, vifs_vestige, Viridian, Will M., Wrexbe, Zandario</em></p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>We decided to use BLAKE2b instead of SHA-256 going forward due to improved hashing speed.
