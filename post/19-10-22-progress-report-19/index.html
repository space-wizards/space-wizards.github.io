This one is absolutely huge now. Oops.</p><h2 id=combat-work>Combat Work</h2><h3 id=attack-animations>Attack Animations</h3><p>So the flashiest thing: we have semi functional melee combat now!</p><div class=section-shadow><video src=/video/pr_19/attack-animations.mp4 class="angle-rect optional" loop playsinline controls></video></div><p>A core part of making a combat system fun is making sure the animations work well. Feedback to every party involved is incredibly important to make sense of what is going on in a fight, and to make the experience more enjoyable.</p><p>I wanted to make sure the animations were short but still quite clear. Personally I&rsquo;m not a fan of those slow hovering sprite animations you see on some servers. When you land a hit, it should be immediately obvious to you and everybody around you.</p><p>You may also notice that we&rsquo;re definitely not using &ldquo;you have to click on the sprite&rdquo; combat like in BYOND. As much as I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRPBEC8hWhE">this</a> is a great meme, it just kinda sucked, and I think we can do better.</p><h3 id=combat-mode-aka-intents-v2>Combat Mode (AKA, Intents v2)</h3><p>Intents are a core mechanic of SS13 combat. They&rsquo;re also basically not a mechanic outside of combat.
Really, the most significant thing intents do is change the behavior for unarmed interactions. There are some odd interactions here and there but due to how rare they are, you never expect them and only learn about them when somebody tells you or you accidentally hit yourself.</p><p>Our idea is this: <strong>There are only two intents</strong>, namely combat mode or not.</p><p>Outside combat mode you can do anything you normally can, use tools, hug people, etc&mldr; You should not be able to directly do violent interactions outside combat mode. No more hitting yourself with your crowbar while prying up floors!</p><p>Inside combat mode, all your interactions are <em>somehow</em> violent. Every item is a weapon in some capacity.</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/combat_mode.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/combat_mode.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><p>Yeah I need to get around to updating the styling info on that targeting doll.</p><p>One consequence of how combat mode is currently implemented is that you can&rsquo;t even pick up items. There are also issues like hitting <em>specific</em> objects. Fancy arcing weapons is cool and all but if you just want to smash a light on the wall it doesn&rsquo;t work nicely.</p><p>Ideally, there would be a separate way to do &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; attacks that act more like BYOND SS13 combat. There&rsquo;s a few possibilities, such as wide arcing combat needing to be &ldquo;charged up&rdquo; for a split second. The other option is to make it a separate keybind like ctrl+click. <strong>Let me know what you think here</strong>.</p><p>For now, toggling combat mode is bound to the &ldquo;1&rdquo; key on your number row. This was after it was bound to tab and I got annoyed by constantly triggering it when alt tabbing. I&rsquo;m still not sure that&rsquo;s a great place for it, since we probably want to use the number row for action buttons later, so <strong>suggestions welcome</strong>.</p><h2 id=hacking--access-contributed-by-damianx>Hacking & Access (Contributed by DamianX)</h2><div class=section-shadow><video src=/video/pr_19/hackerman.mp4 class="angle-rect optional" loop playsinline controls></video></div><p>Both hacking and access is in! Our plans are to keep the systems mostly the same as in SS13.</p><p>Hacking in SS13 is a really simple system and it strikes a great balance between &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not too hard to do&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s inconvenient enough to make you want to get a proper ID&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t see much to change here except maybe in the interface and such.</p><p>Access is in the same boat, here. I&rsquo;ve read suggestions about having access be like controlled by a central server, but really, the beauty is in the simplicity here.</p><p>We didn&rsquo;t make any of the airlocks on the map require access yet (because we haven&rsquo;t bothered) but the system is there. We also have an ID card computer!</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/id_computer.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/id_computer.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><p>Right now, the hacking interface is taken straight from SS13. Me (PJB) and Injazz designed a better one, but it hasn&rsquo;t been implemented yet.</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/hacking_mockup.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/hacking_mockup.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><p>This design is not exactly final, as it doesn&rsquo;t match the new theme we came up with. Read on about that.</p><h2 id=redesigned-ui-theme>Redesigned UI Theme</h2><p>So the old UI theme was kind of ugly and generic. So I decided to fix that.</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/apc_mockup.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/apc_mockup.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><p>This interface specifically is not properly implemented yet, <strong>but the lobby is!</strong></p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/lobby.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/lobby.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><p>My priorities when designing this theme were like this:</p><ol><li>Function</li><li>Looking cool</li><li>Immersion</li></ol><p>With the third point, I mean making the interfaces make logical sense in the context of the game. For example it&rsquo;s not unlikely NT would just use cheap, ugly & functional LCD panels for the APC, making the UI pixelated and probably like 16 color or whatever.</p><p>Personally, I think these kinds of designs go in hard against the first point. For something as simple as the APC the problem might not be <em>too</em> severe, but when you get into more complex interfaces like the air alarm, which would surely use the same kind of LCD, you&rsquo;re gonna be in for a world of pain.</p><p>This does not rule out interfaces like the hacking interface mockup shown earlier, but it does rule out stuff like &ldquo;ugly 16 color pixelated displays&rdquo;. The hacking interface is something where, through heavy stylization & layout, we get something that still feels sort of immersive (you can see obvious connections to the PCB and such) while not reducing usability.</p><h2 id=basic-chemistry-contributed-by-moneyl--acruid>Basic Chemistry (Contributed by moneyl & Acruid)</h2><p>You can mix reagents, and cause explosions! Not much else though.</p><div class=section-shadow><video src=/video/pr_19/chem-dispenser.mp4 class="angle-rect optional" loop playsinline controls></video></div><p>Yeah, reagent metabolism isn&rsquo;t yet, or syringes, or drinking, you get the gist.</p><h2 id=importing-sprites-from-ss13>Importing sprites from SS13.</h2><p>You might think it&rsquo;s easy to import sprites from SS13. We even have a tool for it.</p><p>We extensively make things that are logically &ldquo;lit&rdquo; on entities such as computer screens ignore the lighting layer. You&rsquo;ve probably noticed this in earlier screenshots and such. This looks great! The problem is that half the sprites I get to import into SS14 literally weren&rsquo;t designed for this, so there&rsquo;s a TON of manually cutting up sprites into extra layers to get everything to look better than ever.</p><p>Many SS13 sprites also don&rsquo;t seem to have explicit depowered variants of their sprites, and when they do they usually don&rsquo;t go far enough. Take the Eris airlock sprites we&rsquo;ve been using for example. There are lights on the keypad and on the top of the door that change color when opening or flicking the deny animation. It makes sense to me that these are actually lights that are always powered, so we made them explicitly ignore lighting. There&rsquo;s no version of the airlock sprite that has this light completely greyed out though! Luckily making these version isn&rsquo;t hard with some saturation/lightness adjustment in an image editor, but it&rsquo;s still something that &ldquo;needs&rdquo; doing.</p><p>The end results, however, are worth it:</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/depowered.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/depowered.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/powered.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/powered.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><h2 id=very-basic-research-contributed-by-zumorica>Very Basic Research (Contributed by Zumorica)</h2><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/research.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/research.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><p>As always, the interface could use some work, and some of the exact mechanics could use some thought.</p><p>But hey, progress is being made.</p><h2 id=more-clothes-contributed-by-metalgearsloth>More Clothes (Contributed by metalgearsloth)</h2><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/clothes.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/clothes.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><p>Oh yeah, this is just a fraction of them. It&rsquo;s getting to the point now where the entity spawn panel hangs for a bit when first opened because it has to load all the textures at once. We should probably organize that a bit more.</p><h2 id=map-extensions>Map Extensions</h2><p>When we add new features, we like to put them on the map. As such, I mapped a basic science & medical department. Moneyl also mapped a tool storage/construction kinda room to the left of engineering.</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/science.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/science.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/medical.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/medical.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_19/tool_storage.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_19/tool_storage.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><p>Filling these places up can be a challenge with our lack of implement props, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll improve the situation over time.</p><h2 id=more-effort-into-examine-tooltips>More Effort Into Examine Tooltips</h2><p>Writing fancy examine tooltips used to be pretty annoying.
