	<p>You&rsquo;re reading this on the new website for SS14! After <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif">lots of hard work with CSS</a>, the website is ready to recieve progress reports and other news.</p>
<p>The website is hosted entirely from GitHub pages, which means it&rsquo;s fast, reliable <!--Citation Needed, GitHub goes down more than I'd like to. --> and secure, with zero cost to us (except for designing and writing it). It&rsquo;s completely static server side, and generated with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, an excellent tool for making static sites like this. Adding a page is as simple as making a new markdown file with title, and date and building it. Easy as that!</p>
<p>The code for the website can be found <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-wizards.github.io-content">here</a>. Which is also where commits will go for new blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="progress">Progress!</h2>
<p>Now, since this is the first blog post on the site, I want to give a quick run down of the status of SS14 since the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ss14/comments/5yd7fh/march_2017_update/">last progress report made in March by Silvertorch5 on /r/ss14</a>.</p>
<p>The project has been revived pretty heavily. We&rsquo;ve already refactored everything over a couple times by now. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of new developers (including me!) and we&rsquo;re ready to take this remake on head first.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re retargeting the main repo to be a more &ldquo;bare engine&rdquo; sort of deal. There will not be a lot of content in it (excluding debug content). All of this content will be loaded from an external set of files that can be loaded on a per server basis, thus ensuring that players only need one client for every server. We&rsquo;ve made a repo for a &ldquo;base&rdquo; set of content that other repos can branch off <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14-content">here</a>. In general most of the work is focused on getting this functional so we can start hitting clowns with toolboxes.</p>
<p>Lots of assorted refactors that touch the entire project have been made to allow us to pave the way for a more easy development environment, content <em>and</em> main engine. The repo was pretty bad organizational a few weeks ago, but a couple large refactors later and it&rsquo;s already lots more manageable, and we can actually start putting in serious work now.</p>
<p>For example, previously the project was a giant mess that didn&rsquo;t even conform to the same programming paradigms, this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SS14.Client</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Client.Graphics</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Client.Services</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Client.GameObjects</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Client.Interfaces</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Server</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Server.Services</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Server.GameObjects</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Server.Interfaces</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Shared</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Shared.GameObjects</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Shared.IoC</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This was a giant mess in more ways than I can explain with that small list. Now it looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SS14.Client</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Client.Graphics</code>, but Silver is in the process of removing this one too.</li>
<li><code>SS14.Server</code></li>
<li><code>SS14.Shared</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Hooray for clean up!</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the biggest elephant in the room! We&rsquo;re fixing systems, discussing design targets, documented the code that&rsquo;s undocumented. We&rsquo;re working on setting up a proper project management board to allow us to easily delegate tasks and go &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a list of things we can work on right now. Pick something you like!&rdquo;. This is still a bit off, but when it&rsquo;s done it&rsquo;ll be in the next progress report I guarantee you. This project management board will be extremely helpful to allow us to make these progress reports more easily in the future, too!</p>
<p>So for more stuff to report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sood has been working on IPv6 networking and updating the years out of date version of Lidgren.Network in our code. Sadly Lidgren isn&rsquo;t being updated anymore, but it&rsquo;s still highly reliable. We are talking about moving to an alternative, LiteNetLib, as a very long term goal, because of obvious maintenance issues with Lidgren (IPv6 support is through an unmerged old PR on the Lidgren repo.)</li>
<li>Sood helped redo all the EOLs to be LF (UNIX). I now have the most line changes of any single person on the repo and I don&rsquo;t deserve it.</li>
<li>Silvertorch5 continues working on RobustEngine, the name we debubbed for the rendering engine that will be powering the client. As much as it is demotivating, SFML was a giant terrible mistake, a BYOND level mistake, but giving up isn&rsquo;t the solution, shit happens.</li>
<li>A fancy splash screen, a joint project between me, Silver and PsyKzz. <a href="/images/splash.png">Check it out</a></li>
<li>All around performance improvements.</li>
<li>Tons of general bug fixes for things that get in the way even when you&rsquo;re developing the engine.</li>
<li>Set up automatic code anlysis to catch bugs and yell at us.</li>
<li>Better support for non-Windows operating systems all around.</li>
<li>Acruid is moving the config system to TOML, a proper config file format, instead of XML.</li>
<li>On the front end &ldquo;developer experience&rdquo; side of things, we&rsquo;ve decided on a new YAML prototyping system for entities. Code will still be in C# (but dynamically loaded). The result is it&rsquo;ll still be extremely fast, type safe, and easy to develop on both client and server. See <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/blob/939f14eba7e49c207b9de46037f8717e20bf76cc/SS14.Server/Prototypes/Containers.yml">this file</a> for an example of what it looks like now.</li>
</ul>
<p>However picking a fine line between these and other PRs is kind of hard, so if you want to see every PR merged recently, <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Amerged%20">here you go</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I can assure you: SS14 is not dead. And we&rsquo;re gonna finish this.</strong></p>
