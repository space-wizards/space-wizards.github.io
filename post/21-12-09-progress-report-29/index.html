off into a separate progress report. From November 4th to December 4th, the Space Station 14 code base had 357 contributions made - easily beating the two month period covered by Progress Report 28.</p><p>This progress report features two new playable maps: Packed Station and Knightship, along with the return of the Chaplain, Chemist, and Warden. Also featured are liquid carpets, liquid bees, milkable cows, and new ways to make shuttles move.</p><p>The past month has also been huge for the player base, with thousands of new players being accepted into the Steam playtest each week. The game reached a new peak of over 100 players on at once, and continues to be populated every day.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h2 id=maps>Maps</h2><h3 id=packed-station>Packed Station</h3><p><em>Contributed by Timrod, Solbusaur, 20kdc and Efruit</em></p><p>The station that the /vg/ wiki describes as &ldquo;Like eating poison ivy&rdquo; is back! Designed to support SS14&rsquo;s growing player base, Packed Station is a nearly completely accurate port of the map as seen on /vg/&rsquo;s SS13 codebase with some new features - like a full Atmos department (codenamed &ldquo;The Hand of Atmosia&rdquo;) designed by Solbusaur and an SS14-compliant wiring system by Efruit. 20kdc added support for the Traitor Deathmatch gamemode and filled the hallways with trash. There may be another surprise somewhere - but you&rsquo;ll have to explore it to find out.</p><p>Packed Station supports up to 50 players, and can be voted for once the server is over 15 players. It also supports three returning jobs not seen on Saltern - the Quartermaster, Chaplain, and Warden.</p><p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_29/packed_1.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_29/packed_1.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_29/packed_2.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_29/packed_2.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div></p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=knightship>Knightship</h3><p><em>Contributed by 20kdc</em></p><p>20kdc invoked the 25th-century minimalist movement in creating Knightship, a tiny, efficient ship-style station designed for up to 8 players where most jobs are done by the Heads of Staff - but are they really the head of anything when they&rsquo;re the only person in their department?</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_29/knightship.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_29/knightship.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=syndicate-puddle-jumper>Syndicate Puddle-Jumper</h3><p><em>Contributed by 20kdc</em></p><p>Having determined that Nanotrasen&rsquo;s station captains have been lulled into a false sense of security, the Syndicate has launched their first shuttle for carrying heavily-armed nuclear ops teams to the station.

They&rsquo;re also the number one source of anxiety among mappers, who live in constant fear that they forgot one somewhere. Thanks to mirrorcult, maps ported from SS13 can feel a little more like SS13.</p><div class="section-shadow d-flex justify-content-center"><picture class=p-2><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_29/dir_windows_1.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_29/dir_windows_1.png class="angle-rect optional">

As a result, you&rsquo;ll no longer need to ask &ldquo;Does that monkey have a gun?&rdquo; because yes, it does. This also allows the vicious and highly lethal space carp to survive their natural habitat.</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_29/monkey_murder.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_29/monkey_murder.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=cow-milking>Cow milking</h3><p><em>Contributed by FoLoKe</em></p><p>For ages, the Chef has asked a single question: &ldquo;How do I get milk?&rdquo; FoLoKe answered that by allowing the Chef (or anyone with a bucket) to milk cows that have been properly fed.

These range from deadly radiation pulses to the station being hit by meteors.</p><p>In an unrelated note, Centcom is reporting that the highly annoying and extremely fast-growing Space Kudzu has once again reappeared in local space. Centcom recommends the use of flame-based weaponry like welders, along with liberal application of the &ldquo;wide attack&rdquo; button, to combat this new menace.</p><p>Centcom would also like to remind you that &ldquo;the station is being eaten by a horrible plant&rdquo; is not on the list of valid reasons for handing out the nuclear codes.</p><p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_29/kudzu_1.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_29/kudzu_1.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_29/kudzu_2.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_29/kudzu_2.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div></p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=radiationstorm-shader--sfx>Radiationstorm shader & sfx</h3><p><em>Contributed by Efruit</em></p><p>It&rsquo;s a known fact that radiation storms in space do not look like flat green circles, something that Efruit fixed by implementing a new (and much more visually impressive) shader for bursts of radiation, as well as a new set of sound effects to match.</p><div class=section-shadow><video src=/video/pr_29/radiation.mp4 class="angle-rect optional" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video></div></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=nettles>Nettles</h3><p><em>Contributed by Rane</em></p><p>Since their introduction to Space Station 14, the Botanists have had a difficult time finding ways to cause chaos.

Regrettably, this means the Head of Personnel can no longer feed Ian entirely with chocolate bars from the vending machines.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=job-refactor>Job refactor</h3><p><em>Contributed by moony</em></p><p>moony changed the way Centcom hands out jobs, retiring the dartboard in HR that was used previously. Each station map now has its own job list based on what the station supports - as an example, Packed Station has a Chaplain slot while Saltern and Knightship do not. This also allows Centcom to have more than one station in space at the same time, with each having its own crew.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=epinephrine-and-autoinjectors>Epinephrine and Autoinjectors</h3><p><em>Contributed by mirrorcult</em></p><p>The starting equipment for everyone on the station has gotten a bit heavier thanks to Mirrorcult, who added epinephrine autoinjectors to the survival box all players start with. These can be used to revive people who have gone into critical health&mldr; or to poison people with a highly lethal overdose. Epinephrine has also been added to the list of chemicals Chemistry can make, giving the chemists something new to leave lying around on the floor in pill form.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=bee-chemical--electrocution-chemical>Bee chemical & Electrocution chemical</h3><p><em>Contributed by moony</em></p><p>You really can liquefy just about anything - as moony proved by adding in liquid bees and liquid electricity.

The first decals to be implemented are crayon drawings, which are now part of the floor rather than an object that sits on top of it.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h2 id=technical>Technical</h2><h3 id=update-to-net-6-and-c-10>Update to .NET 6 and C# 10</h3><p><em>Contributed by DrSmugleaf and PJB</em></p><p>RobustToolbox and Space Station 14 were updated this month to use .NET 6 and C# 10, the latest release of both standards. While this change mostly affects contributors (who will have to update to a development environment that supports these standards if they haven&rsquo;t already) it also comes with some small performance boosts out of the box.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=test-pooling>Test pooling</h3><p><em>Contributed by DrSmugleaf</em></p><p>DrSmugleaf pooled a bunch of tests Github uses when testing code contributions, reducing the time they take by 57% to an average of just 90 seconds. For contributors, this means less time taken between each code commit. For players, this instead means that coders can speedrun a patch that fills every inventory slot with banana peels even faster.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=rsiedit>RSIEdit</h3><p><em>Contributed by DrSmugleaf</em></p><p>&ldquo;It looks like ass&rdquo; - DrSmugleaf</p><p>RSIEdit is a development tool for creating Robust Station Image (RSI) files, which contain all of the sprites used in SS14 - as well as their animation states, rotations, and relevant license information. While it doesn&rsquo;t support sprite editing, it does allow contributors to directly import sprites from the DMI files used by BYOND to store sprite data.</p><div class=section-shadow><picture><source type=image/webp srcset=/images/post/pr_29/rsiedit.webp><img src=/images/post/pr_29/rsiedit.png class="angle-rect optional"></picture></div></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=automatic-client-zipping>Automatic client zipping</h3><p><em>Contributed by 20kdc</em></p><p>20kdc added automatic compression for parts of SS14&rsquo;s source code, making it easier than ever to host an SS14 fork.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h3 id=pvs-refactor>PVS Refactor</h3><p><em>Contributed by PaulRitter</em></p><p>Paul optimized and cleaned up the code governing the Potentially Visible Set (PVS, for short) system, which dictates what you can see in-game. This ensures that you&rsquo;ll only see what&rsquo;s around you, and not the horrible atrocities being committed by the chef behind closed doors.</p></div><div class="section-shadow section-bg container mb-4 py-3 angle-rect optional"><h2 id=credits>Credits</h2><h3 id=contributors-since-last-progress-report>Contributors Since Last Progress Report</h3><p><em>713 commits, authored by:</em></p><p>20kdc, AJCM-git, Acruid, Alex Evgrashin, AndresE55, Antoine Chavasse, Azzy, Clyybber, DrSmugleaf, EFR, Rane, Ephememory, Flipp Syder, FoLoKe, Hoolny, ElectroSr, Matt, Mith-randalf, Moony, Nikita Brancatisano, Pancake, Paul Ritter, Peptide90, Pieter-Jan Briers, ShadowCommander, Spartak, Swept, T-Stalker, TaralGit, TemporalOroboros, TimrodDX, Tomeno, Visne, Daemon, ZorenZal, cheesePizza2, hubismal, iczero, ike709, metalgearsloth, mirrorcult, moonheart08, pointer-to-null, shaeone, wrexbe, xRiriq, Zumorica</p><h3 id=patrons>Patrons</h3><p>Alex Tempest, Altana, Anthony Fleck, Await Future, Blaise M., Bobberunio, Chase Trotter, Citizen Battle, clyf, CPM311, Daniel Thompson, Darren Brady, Daskata, DramaBuns, Durp, Eric VW, Ethan Keller, Evan Armstrong, Farewell Fire, Florian, Kerb 755, KrystalDisc, Mono, Nicholas Hillblom, Robin Rottstock, S.C., spinnermaster, ThatGuyGW, The Hateful Flesh, Tomeno, Valinov, vifs_vestige, Viridian, Will M., Zandario</p></div></article></div></main><div id=footer-wrap class=section-shadow><footer class="bottom-links container angle-rect optional mb-2"><ul class="m-2 p-0 d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center"><li><a href=https://github.com/space-wizards title=GitHub><i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://docs.spacestation14.com title=Documentation><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Developer Wiki</a></li><li><a href=https://wiki.spacestation14.io/wiki/Main_Page title="Player Wiki"><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Player Wiki</a></li><li><a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255460/Space_Station_14/ title=Steam><i class="fab fa-steam-symbol"></i> Steam</a></li><li><a href=https://www.patreon.com/spacestation14 title=Patreon><i class="fab fa-patreon"></i> Patreon</a></li><li><a href=https://discord.ss14.io/ title=Discord><i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Discord</a></li><li><a href=https://forum.spacestation14.com title="SS14 Forums"><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Forum</a></li><li><a href=https://lemmy.spacestation14.com title=Lemmy><i class="fas fa-stream"></i> Lemmy</a></li><li><a href=https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@spacestation14 rel=me title=RSS><i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Mastodon</a></li><li><a href=/about/contact/#email title=Email><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> Email</a></li><li><a href=/index.xml title=RSS><i class="fas fa-rss"></i> RSS</a></li><li><a href=/about/privacy/ title="Privacy Policy"><i class="fas fa-shield"></i> Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></footer></div></body></html>
