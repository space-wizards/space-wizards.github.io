Immerse yourself into your role, tinker with detailed systems, and survive the chaos in this round-based multiplayer role playing game.</p><p>Your custom character can spawn as one of dozens of crew and enemy jobs, ranging from engineer to captain, or even a traitor, each with its own unique gear. Your duties guide you through rich interactions with complex mechanics, whether you&rsquo;re managing your inventory, setting up the reactor, or flushing yourself down the disposal tubes.</p><p>As disaster, incompetence, and sabotage strike the station, the tension rises - opening up emergent situations that force you to make hard choices. Will you patch up the medical bay after an asteroid punches a hole in it, or fight for control when the captain gets murdered by revolutionaries? Do you break out an unjustly imprisoned clown, or sit back at the bar and serve drinks without a care in the world?</p><p>The story of the station&rsquo;s collapse is in the hands of its players, and each round is an intense, immersive experience that will leave you wanting more.</p><h1 id=beyond-space-station-14>Beyond Space Station 14</h1><p>Space Station 14 is open-source and extremely extensible. Community servers are the backbone of the game, and can change every aspect of it to provide wildly different experiences. Altered mechanics, different roleplay atmospheres, and completely unique settings are all one click away from the server browser.</p><h2 id=status>Status</h2><p>Currently, the project is in a &ldquo;pre-alpha&rdquo; state. We have many tasks ahead of us. On this website you will be able to find progress reports as long as we&rsquo;re still kicking.</p><h2 id=getting-involved>Getting involved</h2><p>Rome was not built in a day, and neither was SS14. We can always use extra hands!

BYOND is an incredibly dated engine, and is not cutting it. It&rsquo;s a pain to develop for, slow, proprietary, and looks like it&rsquo;s from 2005. Along with this we will try to make the game more enjoyable all around, such as pixel movement and a consistent style.</p><p>Originally, the SS14 project was a continuation of <a href=https://forum.ss13.co/>Goonstation</a>&rsquo;s remake attempt, which was abandoned and <a href=https://archive.fo/xey2L>open sourced on 19 of January, 2015</a>.</p><details><summary>Silver's Account 09/11/2017</summary><p>The project was open sourced January of 2014. Many developers came together from many codebases to form the Open Source team. Much progress was made here, but then the daunting task of replacing the engine in order to make the game cross platform was created. Two developers tried to replace the rendering engine (gorgon), of which both either left for real life or other reasons. This Open source period lasted about four months before developers started trickling away as nothing could be done until the rendering engine was replaced. I started here and took the task of adding SFML. I completed it after three months of work but it was too late as most of the developers were already gone.</p><p>From that point on I spent two years just learning and spent the majority of my time actually learning OpenGL.</p><p>Then PJB hit me up and she took the reins of refactoring the ever living shit out of this project trying to make everything modular. Bobdabiscuit made this discord and everyone here has worked to create a common ground for codebases to branch off of</p><p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it for the history, the rest is to be created.</p></details><p>Space Station 14 has been built from the ground to be fast, modular, cross-platform, as well as fully moddable and extendable. Anyone can add basic items or variations to the game via the easily accessible YAML prototype system, and with some knowledge of C#, add or modify even core functionalities and systems.</p></article></div></div></main><div id=footer-wrap class=section-shadow><footer class="bottom-links container angle-rect optional mb-2"><ul class="m-2 p-0 d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center"><li><a href=https://github.com/space-wizards title=Github><i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://docs.spacestation14.io title=Documentation><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Documentation</a></li><li><a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255460/Space_Station_14/ title=Steam><i class="fab fa-steam-symbol"></i> Steam</a></li><li><a href=https://www.patreon.com/spacestation14 title=Patreon><i class="fab fa-patreon"></i> Patreon</a></li><li><a href=https://discord.gg/t2jac3p title=Discord><i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Discord</a></li><li><a href=https://forum.ss14.io title="SS14 Forums"><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Forum</a></li><li><a href=https://lemmy.spacestation14.com title=Lemmy><i class="fas fa-stream"></i> Lemmy</a></li><li><a href=https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@spacestation14 rel=me title=RSS><i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Mastodon</a></li><li><a href=/about/contact/#email title=Email><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> Email</a></li><li><a href=/index.xml title=RSS><i class="fas fa-rss"></i> RSS</a></li></ul></footer></div></body></html>
